# terraform-provider-unifi

This is very much WIP, just adding functionality as I need it for my local setup.

**Note** You can't (for obvious reasons) configure your network while connected to something that may disconnect (like the WiFi). Use a hard-wired connection to your controller to use this provider.

Functionality first needs to be added to the [go-unifi](https://github.com/paultyng/go-unifi) SDK.
